<p>I currently work at Colony Elementary School located in London, Kentucky. This page will serve as place to get ideas for lesson plans and stories of implementing those plans well and where I can see room for improvement as the librarian. I think it's important to share both victories and defeats, as we humans seem to learn more from our failures than from our successes.</P>
