		<BR><P><b><I>I have created this website for future use in my professional career, an online resume of sorts.</I> So, let's get to it.</b></BR>
				<EM><strong>I have been in teaching for 5 years.</strong></EM> My undergraduate degree is in Interior Design from the University of Southern Mississippi. I attended USM while my then husband worked active duty on a local Army base. I completed my degree in July of 2009 after working for Hubbuch & Co. in Lexington, KY. After my internship with Hubbuch, I became their fulltime receptionist and resource librarian, calling in textile and furniture reps for updated samples and catalogue books. 
				After I had my son in 2011, I stayed home to be a full-time mother for three years, adding my daughter to the mix in 2013. 
				Due to a change in home life, I returned to the workforce in January 2014, becoming a receptionship for the local educational cooperative. It was there that my love of education began.
